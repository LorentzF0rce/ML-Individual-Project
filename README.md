This is machine learning individual project.

Description:
 Nowadays, people are facing with more physical issues and spend plenty of money on medical insurance. However, each person may has totally different physical features and living habits. In order to help people manage their money efficiently,  we are trying to forecast people's medical insurance cost  based on many factors such as city of residence, smoking, sex and so on. 
 
 We came up with some ideas to solve this problem. For example, we can use linear regression or polynomial regression to fit the training data and check the accuracy with test data as well as using model selection method. Moreover, we thought that we can apply Lasso or Ridge regression method to emphasize some important coefficients that have huge impacts on our results and drop some unrelated elements.
